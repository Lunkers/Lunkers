- Hi, I’m Fredrik, a.k.a @Lunkers!
- I'm currently in the final semester of my MSc at KTH in stockholm, writing my thesis at @SVT investigating deep learning fo video upscaling. 
- My main interests are video tech and infoviz, but that doesn't mean I'll refuse an interesting job that doesn't include those fields.
- You can reach me at flundkvi@kth.se
